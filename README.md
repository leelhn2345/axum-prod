# Axum Prod

The source code for [zero to production in
rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html) uses
[`actix-web`](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) as its webframework.

I feel that the book has huge re-read value, and I would like to reimplement the
source code with [`axum`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). There are also
other crates that i would like to experiment with, such as ['utoipa'](https://github.com/tamasfe/aide).

## Todos

- [ ] implement utoipa
- [ ] replace `cargo test` with `nextest` in CI
